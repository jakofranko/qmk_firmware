# jakofranko's Preonic layout

The primary changes I've made to the default layout is replacing the default delete key with the return key, and adding RSHIFT where the default return key was so that I can use both shift keys. The delete functionality was moved to the raise and lower layers for the backspace key.

Additionally, I removed the DVORAK and COLMAK layouts and added RGB controls to the ADJUST layer.

I also moved things around in the raise and lower layers to replace the redundant numbers layer with their symbol counter parts. It's more useful this way I think and makes the raise and lower switches behave a bit more consistently.
